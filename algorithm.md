# 3. Intuition of the algorithm's operation
Having formulated the problem, I now design the algorithm for the XYZ based on asdfghjk.  I describe the  algorithm I implemented and I provide an intuition on how it works for the XYZ I formulated previously. 

## 3.1 Algorithm(s)
* overview
### The Algorithm

   
I begin the algorithm by asdfghjl.

## 3.3 Pseudocode
The algorithmic design can be defined as follows:

## 3.2 Steps

### 3.2.1 Initialization  


### 3.2.2 Agent Behaviour
if any?

### 3.2.3 State Transition 
if any?

### 3.2.4 Global and Local Updates
if any?

### 3.2.5 Termination Conditions


### 3.2.6 In detail:
In detail, the steps of the algorithm are defined as shown below.  Alternatively, you can view a breakdown of the codes [here]().

**Step 1: Import libraries.**

**Step 2: Define x functions.**

**Step n:**
