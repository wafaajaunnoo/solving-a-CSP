# 2. Combinatorial Problem Formulation
<!--In Artificial Intelligence, the following steps are to be followed when solving problems:

1. Problem definition (specify inputs and acceptable solutions).
2. Problem analysis.
3. Knowledge representation (provide detailed information about the problem and define all possible techniques).
4. Problem-solving (selection of best technique(s)).
-->
I start this section by defining a _problemName_.  I follow with the simplification of the different levels of the complexity, which I define as the *constraints* and *objectives*.  Later, I argue the rationale behind my choice to solve the _problemName_ with the _algorithmName_ [hereafter: ASDF].

## 2.1 The Travelling Salesman Problem
* Brief overview of the problem
 

### Context:
In particular, I outline a scenario to show the implementation of XYZ in the real world.

_insert problem scenario_

### TSP Formulation
For simplicity, I formulate the following ABC:

_insert problem formulation_

## 2.2 Problem Complexity

A logical way to present a CSP problem is by its constraints and an objective function.

### 2.2.1 Constraints
asdfghjkl
   
### 2.2.2 Objectives
asdfghjkl

## 2.3 Problem-solving
In theoretical Computer Science, XYZ is solved using  algorithms that diversofy on their levels fo compelxity basing on the levels of complexity of the CSP.

asdfghjkl write something:

1. algorithm i can't remember the name of
2. Backtracking
3. Forward Checking


### 2.3.1 fgh Algorithms
Finding an algorithm that reduces computation is necessary to solve the XYZ.
