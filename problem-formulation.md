# 2. Combinatorial Problem Formulation
<!--In Artificial Intelligence, the following steps are to be followed when solving problems:

1. Problem definition (specify inputs and acceptable solutions).
2. Problem analysis.
3. Knowledge representation (provide detailed information about the problem and define all possible techniques).
4. Problem-solving (selection of best technique(s)).
-->
I start this section by defining a _problemName_.  I follow with the simplification of the different levels of the complexity, which I define as the *constraints* and *objectives*.  Later, I argue the rationale behind my choice to solve the _problemName_ with the _algorithmName_ [hereafter: ASDF].

## 2.1 The Travelling Salesman Problem
* Brief overview of the problem
 

### Context:
In particular, I outline a scenario to show the implementation of XYZ in the real world.

_insert problem scenario_

### TSP Formulation
For simplicity, I formulate the following ABC:

## 2.2 Problem Complexity

A logical way to present a CSP problem is by its constraints and an objective function.

### 2.2.1 Constraints
1. Each city can only be visited once.
2. The salesman should arrive at each city within the specified time window.
3. The salesman must minimize both the total distance travelled and the time window violations.
4. The pheromone levels are dynamically updated.
5. The salesperson must return to the initial city after visiting all cities.
   
### 2.2.2 Objectives

## 2.3 Problem-solving
In theoretical Computer Science, XYZ is solved using  algorithms that diversofy on their levels fo compelxity basing on the levels of complexity of the CSP.

asdfghjkl write something:

1. algorithm i can't remember the name of
2. Backtracking
3. Forward Checking

While all of these methods provide optimal solutions to TSP, they are rarely useful beyond the boundaries of theoretical Computer Science.  Therefore, academics came up with Evolutionary Optimization Algorithms. <sup><sub>[[6]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089812211101073X).</sub></sup>

### 2.3.1 fgh Algorithms
Finding an algorithm that reduces computation is necessary to solve the XYZ.
