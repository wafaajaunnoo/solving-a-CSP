# 1. Introduction
For this assignment, I conceptually break down a Complex Constraint Satisfaction Problem [hereafter: CSP] that I formulated and solved using AL techniques- _problemName_ [hereafter: XYZ].  I also provide a detailed understanding of the problem, which includes the explanation of the algorithm, steps, data structures and tests I used to execute the problem in Python.

This repository is divided into the following sections:
1. [Constraint Satisfaction Problem Formulation]()
    * _problemNameFormulation_
    * Levels of complexity
2. [Intuition of the Algorithm's Operation]()
    * Pseudocode
    * Steps
3. [Python Program]()
    * Program
    * Code Breakdown
4. [Performance Comparison]()
6. [Tests' results and analyses]()
7. [Sources and Further Reading]()
