# 1. Introduction
For this assignment, I conceptually break down a Complex Constraint Satisfaction Problem [hereafter: CSP] with 3 levels of difficulties that I formulated and solved using AI techniques - a Quasigroup Existence Problem.  I also provide a detailed understanding of the problem, which includes an explanation of the algorithms, steps, data structures and tests I used to execute the problem in Python.
